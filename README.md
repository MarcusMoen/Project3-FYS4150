# Project3-FYS4150

For algorithms related to problem 9, run command: make 9

For algorithms related to problem 10, run command: make 10

For plotting, run command: python3 plot_exercise_9.py

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to have the follwoing files in your working directory for successfully running the algorithms:

Particle.hpp

Particle.cpp

PenningTrap.hpp

PenningTrap.cpp

Makefile

 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Particle class is a class made to define an object Particle, where the particle's attributes can be initialised.

The PenningTrap class is a class made to define an object Trap, where the trap's paramaters can be defined and initialised. 

The Makefile is for easy compilation, linking and execution.

The file main_project3.cpp is a script to evolve the motions of the particles, using the Trap and Particle objects.

The file ex10project3.cpp is a script to evolve motions of particles using a time dependent electric potential.

The file plot_exercise_9.py ios a python script to plot all the results from the cpp files
